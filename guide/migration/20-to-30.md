# Migrate to OpenIddict 3.0

## What's new?

The announcement listing the changes introduced in this milestone can be found [here](https://kevinchalet.com/2020/12/23/openiddict-3-0-general-availability/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Migrating to OpenIddict 3.0 requires making changes to your database**: existing properties have been reworked and new ones have been added to support the new features.

## Update your packages references

For that, update your `.csproj` file to reference the `OpenIddict.AspNetCore` 3.x metapackage:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="OpenIddict.AspNetCore" Version="3.1.1" />
  <PackageReference Include="OpenIddict.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="3.1.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Ensure your application doesn't reference legacy/unsupported packages

As part of the AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server/OpenIddict merge, the ASOS packages and 2 OpenIddict packages have been marked as legacy
and are no longer supported. Make sure your application (or intermediate libraries) don't reference any of these packages:

| Package name                             |
|------------------------------------------|
| AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Extensions |
| AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Primitives |
| AspNet.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server     |
|                                          |
| Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect.Extensions   |
| Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect.Server       |
|                                          |
| AspNet.Security.OAuth.Introspection      |
| AspNet.Security.OAuth.Validation         |
|                                          |
| Owin.Security.OAuth.Introspection        |
| Owin.Security.OAuth.Validation           |
|                                          |
| OpenIddict.Models                        |
| OpenIddict.Mvc                           |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your application references the `OpenIdConnectConstants` class, update it to use `OpenIddictConstants` instead.

## Update the references to the Entity Framework Core/Entity Framework 6/MongoDB models

If your application references the `OpenIddictApplication`, `OpenIddictAuthorization`, `OpenIddictScope` or `OpenIddictToken` models, update these reference to use
their new names: `OpenIddict[provider name]Application`, `OpenIddict[provider name]Authorization`, `OpenIddict[provider name]Scope` and `OpenIddict[provider name]Token`
(e.g when using MongoDB: `OpenIddictMongoDbApplication`, `OpenIddictMongoDbAuthorization`, `OpenIddictMongoDbScope` and `OpenIddictMongoDbToken`).

## Enable ASP.NET Core integration in the server and validation options

With the base server and validation stacks being decoupled from ASP.NET Core, you now have to explicitly register the ASP.NET Core host in the server/validation options:

```csharp
services.AddOpenIddict()
    .AddServer(options =>
    {
        options.UseAspNetCore();
    })
    .AddValidation(options =>
    {
        options.UseAspNetCore();
    });
```

## Enable the authorization, logout and token endpoints pass-through mode

Unless you're using OpenIddict's events model to handle authorization, logout and token requests, you'll need to enable
the pass-through mode for these endpoints, so that requests can reach your authorization controller as in the previous versions:

```csharp
services.AddOpenIddict()
    .AddServer(options =>
    {
        options.UseAspNetCore()
               .EnableAuthorizationEndpointPassthrough()
               .EnableLogoutEndpointPassthrough()
               .EnableTokenEndpointPassthrough();
    });
```

## Enable ASP.NET Core Data Protection support to ensure existing tokens can still be validated

For that, call `options.UseDataProtection()` in both the server and validation options:

```csharp
services.AddOpenIddict()
    .AddServer(options =>
    {
        options.UseDataProtection();
    })
    .AddValidation(options =>
    {
        options.UseDataProtection();
    });
```

## Use the new request caching APIs, if applicable

In 3.0, the `OpenIddictServerBuilder.EnableRequestCaching()` API - that enabled request caching for both authorization and logout request -
was replaced by 2 separate methods. If your application depends on request caching, don't forget to enable it when migrating to 3.0:

```csharp
services.AddOpenIddict()
    .AddServer(options =>
    {
        options.UseAspNetCore()
               .EnableAuthorizationRequestCaching()
               .EnableLogoutRequestCaching();
    });
```

## Replace JSON.NET by `System.Text.Json`

If you use JSON.NET to serialize or deserialize `OpenIdConnectMessage`, `OpenIdConnectRequest` or `OpenIdConnectResponse` instances,
consider moving to `System.Text.Json` when migrating to OpenIddict 3.0, as 3.0 no longer includes a built-in JSON.NET `JsonConverter` for their
equivalent in 3.0 (i.e `OpenIddictMessage`, `OpenIddictRequest` and `OpenIddictResponse`).

In most cases, this should be as simple as replacing `JsonConvert.SerializeObject()`/`JsonConvert.DeserializeObject()`
by their `System.Text.Json` equivalent: `JsonSerializer.Serialize()`/`JsonSerializer.Deserialize()`.

## Replace calls to the `AuthenticationTicket` extensions by their new `ClaimsPrincipal` equivalent:

OpenIddict 3.0 no longer uses the `AuthenticationTicket` type provided by ASP.NET Core. Instead, everything is now stored in the `ClaimsPrincipal` instance.
If you have calls like `ticket.SetScopes()` or `ticket.SetResources()`, use their new equivalents (e.g `principal.SetScopes()` or `principal.SetResources()`).

## Use the new authentication schemes

In 3.0, the constants used as the ASP.NET Core authentication schemes have changed:

| Old constant name                                 | New constant name (ASP.NET Core host)                       |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenIddictServerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme     | OpenIddictServerAspNetCoreDefaults.AuthenticationScheme     |
| OpenIddictValidationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme | OpenIddictValidationAspNetCoreDefaults.AuthenticationScheme |
| OAuthValidationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme      | OpenIddictValidationAspNetCoreDefaults.AuthenticationScheme |

> [!NOTE]
> In 3.0, the OpenIddict server ASP.NET Core handler supports authenticating userinfo requests. As such, if you use the pass-through mode
> to handle userinfo requests in your own userinfo MVC action, consider using `OpenIddictServerAspNetCoreDefaults.AuthenticationScheme`
> instead of `OpenIddictValidationAspNetCoreDefaults.AuthenticationScheme` for your userinfo endpoint to avoid validating access tokens twice.

## Update your application to work with the new `scope` format

In OpenIddict 3.0, the format of the `scope` claim used in JWT tokens has changed from a JSON array to a single space-separated claim
to match [the JWT access token specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068). To ensure your authorization policies
still work after migrating, consider using the `principal.HasScope()` extension to determine whether a scope has been granted:

```csharp
services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("MyPolicy", builder =>
    {
        builder.RequireAuthenticatedUser();
        builder.RequireAssertion(context => context.User.HasScope("api1"));
    });
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the check the presence of the private OpenIddict `oi_scp` claims that use the same format as in 2.x (i.e one claim per scope value):

```csharp
services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("MyPolicy", builder =>
    {
        builder.RequireAuthenticatedUser();
        builder.RequireClaim(Claims.Private.Scope, "api1");
    });
});
```

> [!CAUTION]
> These 2 options only work with the OpenIddict validation handler as the `oi_scp` claims are not populated by the JWT bearer handler developped by Microsoft.
> If you can't migrate to the OpenIddict validation handler, consider splitting the standard `scope` claim manually to determine whether it contains a specific value.

## Add and apply migrations, if necessary

If your application uses Entity Framework Core or Entity Framework 6, add a migration to react to the schema changes listed below and apply it.

### Updated properties

| Table                    | Column name    | Observations                                                                |
|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenIddictAuthorizations | Subject        | The column is now nullable to support the device authorization flow.        |
| OpenIddictTokens         | CreationDate   | For broader database support, this column is a now a `DateTime` instance.   |
| OpenIddictTokens         | ExpirationDate | For broader database support, this column is a now a `DateTime` instance.   |
| OpenIddictTokens         | Subject        | The column is now nullable to support the device authorization flow.        |

### Added properties

| Table                    | Column name    | Type     | Nullable |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------|----------|
| OpenIddictAuthorizations | CreationDate   | DateTime | Yes      |
| OpenIddictTokens         | RedemptionDate | DateTime | Yes      |

## If necessary, enable hybrid flow support in the server options

In 2.0, the hybrid flow was automatically enabled if both the authorization code and implicit flows were enabled. In 3.0, this is no longer true
and the hybrid flow MUST be explicitly opted in. If you use the hybrid flow, make sure your application calls the `options.AllowHybridFlow()` method:

```csharp
services.AddOpenIddict()
    .AddServer(options =>
    {
        options.AllowHybridFlow();
    });
```

## Update your applications to grant them the appropriate response type permissions

New response type permissions - enforced by default - [have been introduced in 3.0](/configuration/application-permissions.html#response-type-permissions).

If you have many applications to migrate, you can use [this script](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core/issues/1138#issuecomment-713681158)
to infer appropriate response type permissions using the already granted grant types.
