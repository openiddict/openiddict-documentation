# Proof Key for Code Exchange

Initially designed as a way to protect mobile applications from seeing their callback URIs hijacked by a malicious application installed on the same device,
the [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) mechanism has been extended to confidential clients to help mitigate authorization code leakages.
This mechanism is fully supported by all versions of OpenIddict and can be enforced globally or per-client to block authorization requests that don't send PKCE parameters.

## Enabling PKCE enforcement at the global level

Proof Key for Code Exchange can be enforced globally by calling `options.RequireProofKeyForCodeExchange()` in the server options:

```csharp
services.AddOpenIddict()
    .AddServer(options =>
    {
        options.RequireProofKeyForCodeExchange();
    });
```

## Enabling PKCE enforcement per client

Proof Key for Code Exchange can also be enforced per-client by adding it to the list of requirements attached to a client:

```csharp
await manager.CreateAsync(new OpenIddictApplicationDescriptor
{
    ClientId = "mvc",
    ClientSecret = "901564A5-E7FE-42CB-B10D-61EF6A8F3654",
    ConsentType = ConsentTypes.Explicit,
    PostLogoutRedirectUris =
    {
        new Uri("https://localhost:44381/signout-callback-oidc")
    },
    RedirectUris =
    {
        new Uri("https://localhost:44381/signin-oidc")
    },
    Permissions =
    {
        Permissions.Endpoints.Authorization,
        Permissions.Endpoints.Logout,
        Permissions.Endpoints.Token,
        Permissions.GrantTypes.AuthorizationCode,
        Permissions.GrantTypes.RefreshToken,
        Permissions.ResponseTypes.Code,
        Permissions.Scopes.Email,
        Permissions.Scopes.Profile,
        Permissions.Scopes.Roles,
        Permissions.Prefixes.Scope + "demo_api"
    },
    Requirements =
    {
        Requirements.Features.ProofKeyForCodeExchange
    }
});
```
